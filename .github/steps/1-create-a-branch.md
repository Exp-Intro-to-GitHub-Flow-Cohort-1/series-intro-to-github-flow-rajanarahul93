## Step 1: Create a Branch

_Welcome to "Introduction to GitHub"! :wave:_

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a collaboration platform that utilizes [Git](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#git) for versioning. It's a popular place to share and contribute to [open-source software](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#open-source).

### What is a Repository?

A [repository](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#repository) is a project containing files and folders, tracking versions of those files. Learn more about repositories in "[About repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories)" from GitHub Docs.

### What is a Branch?

A [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#branch) is a parallel version of your repository. It allows you to work on specific features without disrupting the main project. Learn more about branches in "[About branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)".

### What is a Profile README?

A [profile README](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) is an "About me" section on your GitHub profile. It showcases information about yourself, visible at the top of your profile page. Learn more about managing your profile README in "[Managing your profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)".

### :keyboard: Activity: Your First Branch

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to your repository. Work on the steps in your second tab while reading the instructions in this tab.
2. Navigate to the **< > Code** tab in the header menu of your repository.

4. In the field, name your branch `my-first-branch`. Use this exact name to trigger the course workflow.
5. Click **Create branch: my-first-branch** to create your branch.

   The branch will automatically switch, and the drop-down bar will reflect your new branch.

6. Wait about 20 seconds, then refresh this page. [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
